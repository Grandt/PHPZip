A pair of PHP classes to generate zip files.

The projects that started these two classes are hosted on PHPClasses.org at the addresses:
Zip      : http://www.phpclasses.org/package/6110
ZipStream: http://www.phpclasses.org/package/6616

Zip.php generates the Zip file in memory (or tempfile) allowing the parent script to save the final Zip file elsewhere, and/or send it to the user.
ZipStream has much of the same features and functions of Zip.php, with a few notable differences, it does not cache and build the zip file on the server, instead it'll send the file to the user as a stream.

See the examples for example usage. The php files have "some" doumentation in them in the form of Javadoc style function headers.

NOTE: Please ensure that output buffering is disabled when using especially ZipStream. It defeats the purpose of the class, and large zip files may cause a memory exceeded exception.
NOTE2: THe Zip and ZipStream classes support UTF-8 in file paths and file comments, and will autodetect UTF-8 strings to that end, however it is up to the user to ensure that other Multibyte chracter sets aren't sent to the class.

TODO:
* Add compression level (at least "compress or store") to ZipStream, and to the Large file option on Zip.php
* Documentation, no one reads it, but everyone complains if it is missing.
* Better examples to fully cover the capabilities of the Zip classes.
* more TODO's.
